# Simple React 
## Modern Front-End Core Concepts 
    Web Component 
    Dynamically Create HTML Element 
    Single Page Application (SPA)
    ROuting, Route Parameter 
    Destructuring and Props 
    Website State 
    Folder Structure 

## React CORE Concept 
    - Core Concepts Discussion 
    - Working with JSX, Dynamic content, Dynamic Style 
    - Pass Dynamic data to coponents, Props 
    - Create Multipe Components 
    - Creta Multiple Coponenst 
    - State, Component state hook and Set State 
    - Load Dyanmic ata, Api Call useEffect Intgrate state 


##  How React Works 
    - What is JSX, React Component, babel Traspiler 
    - Component and how props works 
    - Unidirection data flow 
    - How states works, Asynchronous 
    - How react Hook works 
    - Props vs state 
    - Properties vs attributes 
    - What is react, When to use it
    - Render, virtual dom, diff algorithm

## Web Compoeant 
    - Building blocks of the user interface 
    - 
    - 4 Types of Component
        - Similar in Look, Different in Data (Component)
        - Similar in look, different in data in contain 
        - No Pattern, But breakdown for working purpose 
        - Stand Alone Option 

    
## Template, Dynamically Create HTML elements based on Data 
    - Example: 01 Rest Countries 
    [Rest Countries](Rest countries.index.html)


## Single page Application (SPA), Performance benefit 
    Fast response to user actions. To execute a user's request, an SPA loads a small JSON file instead of a new web page. ...
    High performance and stability. ...
    Fast development. ...
    Desktop-like user experience. ...
    Mobile-friendly.

## Routing, Route Parameter, Routing in React 
    The Router in React JS is primarily used to create Single Page Web Apps. In the application, React Router is utilized to define various routes. When a user enters a URL into your browser and the URL route equals one of several 'pathways' as in the router folder, the user is sent to that route.

    Pass params to a route by putting them in an object as a second parameter to the navigation. navigate function: this. props. navigation. navigate('RouteName', { /* params go here */ })

    Read the params in your screen component: this. props. navigation.  getParam(paramName, defaultValue) .


## Explore Destructuring and send data to html elements using props 
    - Example:01 Rest Countries 
    [Rest Countries](Rest countries.index.html)


## Website state, State management, Purpose of state

    The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.


## Now Go Install React App and Explore Folder Structure and Edit 
    npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
    cd my-react-app 
    npm install 
    npm run dev
